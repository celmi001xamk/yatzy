# Learning react & node with my first app
Goal is to make a single player dice game Yatzy.
First I'll focus on making the game work and then add
a database for users and hiscores.

I work and study full time so giving this project time when I can.

## Todo

Week 5: Refactoring the codebase.

Week 6-7: Starting to implement log-in system and hiscores.
