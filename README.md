# Learning react & node with my first app
Goal is to make a single player dice game Yatzy.
First I'll focus on making the game work and then add
a database for users and hiscores.

I work and study full time so giving this project time when I can.

## Todo

**Currently have put this project aside, not sure when/if coming back**

<del>Refactoring the codebase and adding features.</del>

Log-in system and hiscores
